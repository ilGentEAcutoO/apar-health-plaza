## My Notes

I am not fluent in React; instead, I use Vue.js.

Because of this, I have provided an alternative solution that I am capable of implementing.

Building mobile applications can be done using Capacitor with the help of the Quasar framework.

We can use a Vue.js base for building mobile applications.

Please take a look at the demo below.

Thank you for your consideration.
